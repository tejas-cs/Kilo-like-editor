# Kilo  

A nano-like text editor built with pure C  

Kilo is a simple text editor inspired by the original [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) created by Salvatore Sanfilippo. This project serves as a way to learn more about handling TUI (Text User Interface) interactions without using any external libraries, including ncurses. Instead, Kilo uses standard VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences for text-based UI manipulation.  

Kilo is designed to be lightweight and easy to modify. People are encouraged to use it as a starting point for writing other text editors or command-line interfaces.

## Windows Support üñ•Ô∏è  
Kilo relies on `termios` and `ioctl`, which do not work in the default Windows terminal. To run Kilo on Windows, you need to use **Cygwin** or **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**.  

### Running Kilo in Cygwin  
1. Install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) with the **gcc** and **make** packages.  
2. Open the Cygwin terminal.  
3. Clone and compile Kilo:  
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kilo.git  
   cd kilo  
   make  
   ```  
4. Run Kilo:  
   ```sh  
   ./kilo <filename>  
   ```  

### Running Kilo in WSL  
1. Install **WSL** with an Ubuntu distribution.  
2. Open WSL and follow the standard **How to Install** instructions.
